**Correlation Heatmap Visualization**<br>
<br>
*Overview*<br>
This Jupyter notebook contains code to generate and display a correlation heatmap based on data from a CSV file. The heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlations between different variables in the World Bank dataset, allowing for quick identification of strong positive or negative relationships.<br>
<br>
*Contents*<br>
The notebook includes the following main components:<br>
<br>
Data loading and preprocessing<br>
Correlation heatmap generation<br>
Heatmap display and interpretation<br>
<br>
*Dataset from World bank*<br>
The notebook features the following files:<br>
annual gdp per capita<br>
cardon dioxide emissions<br>
death rate<br>
forest % of land area<br>
gini index inequality<br>
government expenditure per student % of gdp<br>
military expenditure % of gdp<br>
population density<br>
proportion of women in parliament<br>
renewable energy consumption % of final consumption<br>
time required to start a business<br>
<br>
*Requirements*<br>
To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:<br>
<br>
pandas<br>
numpy<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
<br>
You can install these libraries using pip:<br>
Copypip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn<br>
Usage<br>
<br>
Ensure you have a CSV file named correlation_results.csv in the same directory as this notebook. This file should contain your correlation matrix, with each cell containing a string in the format "correlation_value (p=p_value)".<br>
Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Run all cells in the notebook sequentially.<br>
<br>
*Interpreting the Heatmap*<br>
<br>
The heatmap shows correlations between all pairs of variables in your dataset.<br>
Color intensity indicates the strength of the correlation:<br>
<br>
Dark red indicates strong positive correlation<br>
Dark blue indicates strong negative correlation<br>
White or light colors indicate weak or no correlation<br>
<br>
<br>
The diagonal will always show perfect correlation (1.0) as it represents each variable's correlation with itself.<br>
<br>
*Troubleshooting*<br>
If you encounter any issues:<br>
<br>
Ensure your correlation_results.csv file is correctly formatted.<br>
Check that all required libraries are installed and up to date.<br>
Verify that the CSV file is in the same directory as the notebook.<br>
<br>
For any persistent problems, please check the documentation of the libraries used or seek assistance in the respective community forums.<br>
